# CNN_Data_Augmentation
<p> In this technique, we generate new instances of images by cropping, flipping, zooming, shearing an original image. So, whenever the training lacks the image dataset, using augmentation, we can create thousands of images to train the model perfectly.</p>

## Notes
If you still insist to run it on your PC, the `requirements.txt` file should list all Python libraries that the notebook
depends on, please install them on a virtual env using:
<br>


Anaconda:
```
$ conda create --name newenv --file requirements.txt
```
Python3
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
